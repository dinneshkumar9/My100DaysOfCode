**Today's Progress**: Built a Product page project, which was the fourth challenge of FreeCodeCamp. Html and css was used to write the code for this project.
Also added icons and embeded a youtube video.

**Thoughts:** the fourth project was about difficult, did lots of googling , 1 more projects left for course to end.
