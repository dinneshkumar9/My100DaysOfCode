**Today's Progress** : Did a project given by Acciojob. The project was to make Landing page for a site. This was part of Module 5 Test. 

**Thoughts:** : This was interesting project. html , css and bootstrap were used to make it. learned about scrolls , animation and flex and grid by doing the project.
