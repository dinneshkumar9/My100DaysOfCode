**Today's Progress**: Did two projects from AccioJob, 
### 1.Photo Album webpage :
Made a photo album using grid properties of CSS.

### 2.Flex Cards :
Made a simple webpage using bootstrap components.

**Thoughts:** Grids was a new concept for me , i need to deep dive into it. To develop more understanding to use it in future projects. Bootstrap is very interesting thing that i have discovered recently. I want to do more projects using bootstrap.
