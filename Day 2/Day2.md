**Today's Progress**: Went deep dive into CSS color property , learn about RGB, rbga, gradient , opacity etc.
Also build a webpage which displays Color Markers as a mini project learned from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The color makes the webpage more beautiful, we can attract attention of using CSS color and different color combination.
